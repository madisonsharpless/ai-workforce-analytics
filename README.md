# AI & Workforce Analytics (Master’s Thesis)

## Overview
This project analyzes how AI adoption relates to wage trajectories, job demand, job security perceptions, and employee sentiment across tech and non-tech industries.

## Research Questions
- How do wages differ across industries, and what trajectories can be predicted as AI adoption accelerates?
- What concerns and expectations do workers express regarding AI in the workplace?
- Which fields are at greatest risk of change in wages, job demand, and remote work prevalence?
- What implications does AI adoption have for middle-class economic security?
